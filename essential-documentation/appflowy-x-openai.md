### What about privacy?

AppFlowy, the application, sends the encrypted HTTPS requests with data that the user explicitly provided for making OpenAI API calls to only one domain, openai.com. The OpenAI [features](appflowy-x-openai.md#what-are-the-current-functions-of-openai-in-appflowy) only connect to the specified domain: openai.com

The OpenAI key you provided in `Settings` is stored on your local device where you installed AppFlowy.

Since AppFlowy is 100% open-source, you can confirm our practices via the [codebase.](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy)

We encourage AppFlowy users to review how [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) handles their data before using their services.
