# Table-view Databases

A table-view database is also called a Grid. It looks like a classic table but can do more than just rows and columns.

### Create a database in table view

There are two ways:

1.  Click on the `+` icon next to a page, then select "Grid"

2. Create one inside a page. Type `/` to open up the menu. Select `Create a new Grid`

### Rows&#x20;

Every row in a database is a page. You can open a row as a page to edit properties or enter values.

* Hover over a row and click the `Open as a Page` button

* You will see all the properties organized at the top.
  * Click on the property name to edit it or its type.
  * Click in the property field to edit its content.
  * Learn more about how to [manage properties](../databases/manage-properties.md).
* You can also add a new property to your database by clicking `+ New property`.
* You can perform `Delete` and `Duplicate` on the current row.
  * `Delete`: delete this row
  * `Duplicate:` duplicate this row



### Add Rows

* Click the `+` that appears on hover next to any row. This creates a new row below it.
