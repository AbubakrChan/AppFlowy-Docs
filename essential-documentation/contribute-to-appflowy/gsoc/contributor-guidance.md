# Program Guidance

## **Program Description**

The AppFlowy mentorship program is aimed at creating a hands-on learning opportunity for new developers who may otherwise lack the opportunity to gain exposure to real-world software practice and entry to the technical community.

**Benefits for Mentees:**

* Mentees gain exposure to real-world software development and entry to the open-source community.
* Mentees become more competitive in the job market by having more meaningful software development experience.
* Mentees have hands-on opportunities to do work related to their professional interests and to further the pursuit of their interests.
* Mentees expand their professional network by getting involved in the community.

**Benefits for AppFlowy Community:**

* The mentorship program helps identify and bring in new developers to our community.
* More source code gets written and used for the benefit of all.
* The mentorship program helps AppFlowy gain valuable insight into new developer onboarding processes and how to lower the barriers to entry for newcomers.

We know how satisfied and excited people can be when they are a part of a community of dedicated developers in open source. We also understand how overwhelming it can be for newcomers to get started. We would love to offer a place for developers to get their foot in the door and for mentorship to thrive.

A Final evaluation will be conducted at the earlier of the following dates 1) your choice 2) the end of week 24.

## **Getting Started**&#x20;

Please use our [first-time AppFlowy developer guide](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy/contributing-to-appflowy#your-first-codebase-contribution) to get your AppFlowy development environment set up and find your first issue. If you have any trouble, please ask on our community channel.

The applicants are required to complete an issue tagged with the [“good first issue for devs” ](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/labels/good%20first%20issue%20for%20devs)in order to be selected. This requires you to get familiar with our codebase and demonstrates your interest in contributing to AppFlowy. Don’t worry if you make mistakes in your first contribution. Instead, please see it as a great opportunity to get involved in our community, receive feedback, and iterate your work - a flavor of doing a project with the community.

## Application Instructions&#x20;

Once your PR for an issue tagged with the “good first issue for devs” is merged, you can start developing a specific project plan. We recommend discussing your ideas with the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9Q2xaN37tV).

_Applications_ are accepted on a _rolling basis_ and applicants are notified of the decision within 30 days of receipt of a complete proposal. Please use the [suggested proposal template](proposal-template.md) when applying and email your application to annie@appflowy.io

You will need to do thorough research on the AppFlowy codebase, read documentation, and talk with potential mentors to put together a complete project proposal. It’s cool to come up with your own project idea as long as your idea falls under the umbrella of this year’s themes:&#x20;

* Desktop features&#x20;
* CI tools&#x20;
* Tracing performance regressions

Please get in touch with a mentor early on if you want to work on your own idea and make sure it is realistic and within the scope of AppFlowy. We also welcome applicants to work on one of our ideas. Please see [project-ideas.md](../appflowy-mentorship-program/project-ideas.md "mention") for details.

We expect applicants to be excited about gaining real-world software experience and learning practical skills such as problem-solving and asking well-formed questions. We also expect applicants to either have experience with the technologies relevant to their project or have strong general programming experience. We are happy to accept both student and non-student participants.
