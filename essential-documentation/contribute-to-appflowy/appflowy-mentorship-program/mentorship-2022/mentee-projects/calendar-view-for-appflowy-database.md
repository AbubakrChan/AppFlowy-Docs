# Calendar View for AppFlowy Database

## Introduction

AppFlowy's database is an extremely powerful feature that allows users to store data in a structured manner. Each database can be customized to contain multiple fields, each of a different type, such as text, date and single-selection tags. For more information about the terminology used in AppFlowy's database, please check out [grid.md](../../../architecture/frontend/grid.md "mention"). While the most common way to view the database is in a tabular manner, alternative views can present the data better depending on the use case. For example, the kanban board groups entries into columns according to a status tag, and is very popular for project progress tracking. It also allows new ways to interact with the entries, such as dragging a card from one column to another in kanban.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to introduce a calendar view so that users can grasp upcoming (or past) scheduled events at a glance. Users will be able easily identify the duration of an event, if and when events overlap, or how much spacing is between two events. This feature will be especially useful for task scheduling and event planning.
