# üìó Contributor Guidance

## **Getting Started**

Please use our [first-time AppFlowy developer guide](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy/contributing-to-appflowy#your-first-codebase-contribution) to get your AppFlowy development environment set up and find your first issue. If you have any trouble, please ask on our community channel.

Becoming an AppFlowy contributor is a prerequisite. Newcomers are encouraged to complete an issue tagged with the [‚Äúgood first issue for devs‚Äù](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/labels/good%20first%20issue%20for%20devs). This requires you to get familiar with our codebase and demonstrates your interest in contributing to AppFlowy. Don‚Äôt worry if you make mistakes in your first contribution. Instead, please see it as a great opportunity to get involved in our community, receive feedback, and iterate your work - a flavor of doing a project with the community.

## Application Instructions

Once your PR for an issue tagged with the ‚Äúgood first issue for devs‚Äù is merged, you can start developing a specific project plan. We recommend discussing your ideas with the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/9Q2xaN37tV). Please use the [suggested proposal template](../gsoc/proposal-template.md) when applying plus all requirements at the Google Summer of Code Site.

You will need to do thorough research on the AppFlowy codebase, read documentation, and talk with potential mentors to put together a complete project proposal. It‚Äôs cool to come up with your own project idea as long as your idea falls under the umbrella of this year‚Äôs themes:

* Plugins for [AppFlowy Editor](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/appflowy-editor)

Please get in touch with a mentor early on if you want to work on your own idea and make sure it is realistic and within the scope of AppFlowy Editor. We also welcome applicants to work on one of our ideas. Please see [idea-list.md](idea-list.md "mention") for details.

We expect applicants to be excited about gaining real-world software experience and learning practical skills such as problem-solving and asking well-formed questions. We also expect applicants to either have experience with the technologies relevant to their project or have strong general programming experience. We are happy to accept both student and non-student participants.

Some key criteria for mentees:

* Existing AppFlowy contributor
* Likely to become a core community member
* Have a passion for AppFlowy
* Capable of completing at least 60% of the proposed project with limited technical guidance
