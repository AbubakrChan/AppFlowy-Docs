This page is under construction

**Are you an AppFlowy enthusiast? Join the Write for AppFlowy program to help other AppFlowy users and builders, get paid, and build credibility.**

Whether you’re an expert on software or product or a young student just starting, there is knowledge you can share and benefit the entire AppFlowy community. Topics that would help the community the most at the current stage are how-tos, specific use cases, and software development related to AppFlowy’s codebase. We’re looking for both tutorials and deep dives. You get paid for articles published on [AppFlowy Binary](https://blog-appflowy.ghost.io/) and pages posted to [the AppFlowy documentation](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/start-here/welcome-to-appflowy). Your work will be published under your name and a link to your social profile. We pay anywhere between $50 - $350 for content created. We also look for editors with proof of track record to help with style and grammar (link to more details).

#### How does it work?

1. Join our Discord [channel](https://discord.gg/s9yQttsP53) and create a post. Your post should include the topic you want to cover and the outline. The topic can be your own or select an existing GitHub issue tagged with “[write-for-appflowy](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy/labels/write%20for%20appflowy)”.
2. Once you create a post, the AppFlowy team will review it. It may take a few days or weeks for us to review. If we shortlist your topic, we will work with you to refine your outline and agree on an informative and engaging final topic. Then we will create a GitHub issue for the topic and assign the issue to you.
3. After you finish the first draft, you are encouraged to get feedback from the AppFlowy team and a few community members who are your article’s target audience. You should be aware that not every submitted article will be published.
4. Once your article is reviewed and published on our blog, you can submit your invoice to get paid via [Deel](https://www.deel.com/). But that’s not all - we’ll also promote your work on our social media channels, providing greater exposure for your work.
5. Ongoing support is required. You should promptly respond to queries about your published work. How-to guides should remain up-to-date. We may archive your how-to guides if it’s not up-to-date given that our product is still under rapid development and may evolve pretty quickly.

#### What kind of content are we looking for authors?

1. Write a how-to guide explaining some of AppFlowy’s features. This can be from the development or the product user perspective.
2. Share the specific use cases you have with AppFlowy. We are eager to know what you use it for and how other people can borrow your ideas to get similar benefits you have gained.
3. Engineering topics related to AppFlowy always excite us. In particular, we love deep dives or tutorials that lower junior developers' barriers to participating in our open-source projects.

### FAQs

#### Where do I share my drafts?

We use GitHub to collaborate. Once your topic is approved, a page will be created for you to work on in [this repo](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Docs). When you are ready to share your draft, submit a pull request to the page. We’ll provide feedback on your pull request. If you are not familiar with GitHub, don’t worry. We’ll guide you through.
