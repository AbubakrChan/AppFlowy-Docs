# Events

Events are used in the [communication](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy/architecture/frontend/inter-process-communication) between the frontend and the backend.
If you interested in the process about generating the events files, please check [this](https://appflowy.gitbook.io/docs/essential-documentation/contribute-to-appflowy/architecture/backend/event) out.
This document explains the events defined in the database scope.
